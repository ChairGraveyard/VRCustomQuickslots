# VRCustomQuickslots
Custom quickslots mod for SkyrimVR

## Requirements
This mod requires the SkyrimVRTools SKSE plugin (SkyrimVRTools.dll) to provide VR input events.  Please note this is NOT compatible with the old PapyrusVR plugin!

## How To Use
The layout and actions of the quickslots are all set in the config file vrcustomquickslots.xml - Here you can create as many quickslots as you like, set their position and actions.
The actions of each quickslot are defined by SpellIDs and ItemIDs set in the XML file.  To customize the quickslots to your liking, you must edit the XML file.  
View the file vrcustomquickslots.xml for more details.  

## Default Layout
By default, the layout of the quickslots is two on the upper back (left and right), two on the lower back and two at the waist, and one above the head. 

## Credits
Thanks to artumino for the work on PapyrusVR and SkyrimVRTools, the SKSE devs for Skyrim Script Extender, and DougHamil for Dragonborn Speaks Naturally which showed me how to run console commands.
